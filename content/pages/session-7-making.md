## Preface

The following making activity was devised during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when the *SP.248 NEET Ways of Thinking* course was delivered remotely.

We wanted to end the course with a fun, hands-on activity that could still work within the constraints of a remote course. Hence, we came up with the idea of having students cast and mold a wooden figurine using Aljasafe and plaster, which are 100% safe products.

This activity does not involve any ways of thinking, which is why it is included in a separate section on the MIT OCW website. However, feel free to insert it into the SP.248 module sequence, if you wish to, like we did.

Included in the files for this activity, you will find a list of materials for one activity kit, allowing for two tries. 

The suggested sequence for this activity is as follows:

1. Watch the tutorial video together with students and answer any questions they might have about the activity. While they watch the video, each student should check they have all the required materials for the activity.
2. Individual students should attempt to complete the activity on their own, using the tutorial video and the plaster mixing video as references.
3. Once they are done, each student should send you three pictures of the final product (plaster figurine): top, bottom, and side, as well as fill out and submit the activity reflection form. Provide students with feedback, if feasible. 
4. Identify common challenges students had with the activity and discuss them with the entire class.
