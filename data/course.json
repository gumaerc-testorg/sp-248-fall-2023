  "course_description": "This subject gives first-year students a unique opportunity to explore the New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET) program while acquiring valuable problem-solving skills. It introduces students to the NEET Ways of Thinking, which are cognitive approaches for tackling complex challenges, valued by industry and for thriving in an uncertain and rapidly changing world. Student teams will engage in challenge-based learning in interdisciplinary engineering education via the NEET program threads. Student teams will learn how to apply various Ways of Thinking for solving these challenges, including practical methods and tools which they can later use at MIT and beyond.",
